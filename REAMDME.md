This script is based on the script by [Philip Linghammar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xapax/oscp/) which is based off the script by [Mike Czumak](http://www.securitysift.com/offsec-pwb-oscp/). The plan is to turn the scripts into an all emcompassing enumeration platform for network-based technical assessments.
